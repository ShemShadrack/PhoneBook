# PhoneBook
 
Java program that will create a file that will act as a phone book, where a user will be able to make a series of actions such as ‘adding’ a new
contact, ‘deleting’ a contact, ‘modifying’ a contact, ‘searching’ for a contact, ‘displaying’ all
the available contacts and finally ‘counting’ the contacts available.
